In general, the period means “keep everything together”

```R
# facet_grid(drv ~ .), the period means “don’t facet across columns”. 
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .) # facet only by the row

# facet_grid(. ~ drv), the period means “don’t facet across rows”. 
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl) # facet only by the column
```
